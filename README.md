## Description
This webpage is for creating a random password between 8-128 characters using a mixture of characters the user inputs. It was our week 3 project to show the the use of functions and statements to generate a password for the user.

## Usage
Once the user clicks the generate password button they are prompted to give a number for the length of the password, it must be in the parameters of 8-128 and then they are asked whether or not they would like it to include special characters, numbers, lower and uppercase letters. Once the user has been through the prompts they are given a password from the selected criteria in the box that previously contained "Your Secure Password"
